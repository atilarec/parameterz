#summary Calculator for estimating aortic reguritant fraction from echo (jet width, DAO flow VTI's)

== Introduction ==

This is a !JavaScript calculator based on the work presented in

*An Echocardiographic Model Predicting Severity of Aortic Regurgitation in Congenital Heart Disease*

== Details ==

AR fraction is estimated using two variables:

  # relative jet size: vena contracta area / BSA 
  # flow profiles of the DAO: retrograde VTI / antegrade VTI


The calculator can be found here:

The version-controlled js file is here:

I need to think about how to optionally add multiple jet widths (we are to sum their areas), possibly by entering them as a comma separated list.
