#summary About the M-Mode z-score calculator.

[http://parameterz.blogspot.com/2008/09/m-mode-z-scores.html This] z-score calculator is based on the data published in the June 2000 issue of _Heart_

    Normal values of M mode echocardiographic measurements of more than 2000 healthy infants and children in central Europe. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1760862/?tool=pubmed PubMed link]) 

In an effort to provide even more transparency into the manner in which the calculations are made, this summary is provided. 

== About the Calculations ==

Unlike most of the other z-score calculators, the m-mode z-score calculator does not use any prediction equations. Rather, the published tables have been transformed into 'JavaScript' objects.
