#summary About the new (JASE 2010) coronary artery z-score calculator.
== Introduction ==

In an effort to remain transparent about the nature of the calculations, this summary is provided.  

== Details ==

This calculator builds on some of the techniques from other calculators and also introduces a new (for me!), more contemporary, approach to my use of JavaScript objects: prototypes. 

There are two basic approaches to the new z-score equations: bsa-adjusted and aortic valve-adjusted z-scores. The bsa-adjusted calculations are based on slope and intercepts working with the square root of bsa. The basic form I designed for these objects is:

{{{
//these are bsa-adjusted coronaries
function Cor_b(o) {
    this.a1 = o.a1;
    this.b1 = o.b1;
    this.a2 = o.a2;
    this.b2 = o.b2;
}
}}}
