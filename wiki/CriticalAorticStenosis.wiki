== Introduction ==

Several published works are available that aim to use echocardiographic data to help determine the nature of surgical repair for neonates with "critical aortic stenosis". 

These calculators are _works in progress_:

  * [http://parameterz.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rhodes/rhodes-score.htm Rhodes Score Calculator]
  * [http://parameterz.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rhodes/CHSS2-score.htm CHSS Calculator]
  * [http://parameterz.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rhodes/discriminant-score.htm Discriminant Score Calculator]

Eventually, I might compile all three into a single calculator, as many of the data points are common.

== Notes: ==

==== Rhodes Score ====
There is an error in the original article: the formula for the "area of an ellipse" used to calculate the mitral valve area (actually the mitral _annulus_ area) is incorrect; an erratum was later published with the correct formula:

  {{{Area = pi * (D1 / 2 * D2 / 2)}}}

In addition to the actual score, the article also presents four "threshold values"; the current calculator does not concern these additional risk factors. 

==== CHSS Score ====
This calculator is based on the earlier (2001) work from the CHSS- not the current (2007) CHSS calculator (available from the [http://www.ctsnet.org/aortic_stenosis_calc/ CHSSDC website]).

The original article refers to an older source for the z-scores; a more current aortic root z-score is available with the Discriminant Score article. The latest version of the CHSS Score calculator lets you optionally select either z-score reference, to an interesting effect.

==== Discriminant Score ====
This is the updated score which supersedes the Rhodes score.
