== Introduction ==

Several published works are available that aim to use echocardiographic data to help determine the nature of surgical repair for neonates with "critical aortic stenosis". 

These calculators are _works in progress_:

  * [http://parameterz.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rhodes/rhodes-score.htm Rhodes Score Calculator]
  * [http://parameterz.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rhodes/CHSS2-score.htm CHSS Calculator]
  * [http://parameterz.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rhodes/discriminant-score.htm Discriminant Score Calculator]

Eventually, I would like to compile all three into a single calculator, as many of the data points are common.
