## Introduction ##
This is an online calculator modeled after the CHOP fetal cardiovascular profile scoring system proposed in:

## Details ##

The score rates various indices of both donor and recipient cardiovascular performance/remodeling, as measured by fetal echo:

  * Donor
    * umbilical artery flow, as a marker of placental vascular resistance

  * Recipient
    * cardiac size and ventricular hypertrophy
    * ventricular function
    * tricuspid and mitral reguritation
    * inflow Doppler characteristics
    * ductus venosus and umbilical venous flows, as markers of ventricular compliance
    * RV outflow obstruction
    * pulmonary valve insufficiency

The only _calculations_ involved are the sum of the various individual scores and the subsequent grading of of the total score- from '1' to '4'.
